# WarCardGame
C# Implementation of the classic card game war

More attention could also be called to when a war occurs, as the war happens silently without the player being directly aware of it.

There is an edge case, where the game ties. This can occur if both players enter into a war, all of their cards have been commited to the
war, but there is still no winner. This could cause an infinite loop in the game.
