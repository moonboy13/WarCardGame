# WarCardGame
C# Implementation of the classic card game war

Due to the UI thread and main game thread being the same, the UI does not update in time when playing. This often causes you to see the **Previous** hand from the one actually being play.

More attention could also be called to when a war occurs, as the war happens silently without the player being directly aware of it.
